The course will be comprised of both theory and applications. We begin with a condensed review of fundamental concepts from Math 352; particularly, we briefly review important discrete and continuous probability distributions. We will then begin our discussion on the main topic of this course, statistical inference, through the study of distributions of functions of random variables using the method of moment-generating functions and order statistics. We then discuss ideas of convergence with sampling distributions and the central limit theorem. Next, we consider the topics of estimation, properties of point estimators, and methods of estimation. Finally, we study the theory of statistical tests and likelihood ratio tests. Depending on time, other topics may be added or removed.\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrate statistical knowledge and apply it to various data sets.\nUse basic principles of statistical inference (both Bayesian and frequentist).\nBuild a starter statistical toolbox and discuss the utility and limitations of these techniques.\nUse software and simulation to do statistics.\nDemonstrate ability to discuss statistical information in oral and written form.\n\n\n\n\n\nModern Mathematical Statistics (MMS) with Applications, by Jay L. Devore and Kenneth N. Berk , Third Edition, Springer, 2021.

All homework assignments are due at the beginning of class. The homework is to help you practice the concepts learned in lecture and to help you study. You must turn in your own individual homework and show your understanding of the material. At the end of the semester, the three lowest homework grades will be dropped.\n\n\n\nThere will be three exams and Final.\nExam #1 will most likely be during the 6th week of the semester. Exam #2 will most likely be during the 11th week of the semester. Exam #3 will be on December 9, 2024 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM.\nWhile the exams are not considered cumulative, the material builds on each other. Developing a strong understanding of the material through out the course is important for your success.\nAt the end of the semester, your lowest exam grade will be replaced by your median average exam grade.\nThis course will operate under a zero-tolerance policy. Talking during the time of the exam, sharing materials, looking at another students’ exam, or not following directions given will be subject to the\nUniversity’s academic integrity policy.\n\n\n\nThere will be 4 extra credit opportunities worth a total of 10% of your overall grade. (There are no make-ups for missed extra credit assignments!) More information will be provided on the extra credit assignments on a later date.\n\n\n\n\nThe following outline may be subject to change.

Do not submit others’ work as your own. For assignments and quizzes that allow you to work with a group, only put your name on what the group submits if you genuinely contributed to the work. Work completely independently on exams, using only the materials that are indicated as allowed. Failure to observe academic honesty results in substantial penalties that can include failing the course.\nDisabilities:\nIf you are a student with a disability requesting reasonable accommodations in this course, you need to contact Disability Accommodations and Support Services (DASS) located on the second floor of Arroyo Hall, via email accommodations@csuci.edu or call 805-437-3331. All requests for reasonable accommodations require registration with DASS in advance of need: https://www.csuci.edu/dass/students/apply-for-services.htm. Faculty, students and DASS will work together regarding classroom accommodations. You are encouraged to discuss approved.\nEmergency Procedure Notice to Students:\nCSUCI is following guidelines and public orders from the California Department of Public Health and Ventura County Public Health for the COVID-19 pandemic as it pertains to CSUCI students, employees and visitors on the campus. Students are expected to adhere to all health and safety requirements as noted on the University’s Fall 2022 Semester website or they may be subject to removal from the classroom."
