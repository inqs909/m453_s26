Demonstrate statistical knowledge and apply it to various data sets.\n2.  Use basic principles of statistical inference (both Bayesian and frequentist).\n3.  Build a starter statistical toolbox and discuss the utility and limitations of these techniques.\n4.  Use software and simulation to do statistics.\n5.  Demonstrate ability to discuss statistical information in oral and written form.\n\n## Course Description\n\nThis course is an introduction to mathematical statistics with an emphasis on statistical estimation and hypothesis testing. The course will be comprised of both theory and applications. We begin with a condensed review of fundamental concepts from Math 352; particularly, we briefly review important discrete and continuous probability distributions. We will then begin our discussion on the main topic of this course, statistical inference, through the study of distributions of functions of random variables using the method of moment-generating functions and order statistics. We then discuss ideas of convergence with sampling distributions and the central limit theorem. Next, we consider the topics of estimation, properties of point estimators, and methods of estimation. Finally, we study the theory of statistical tests and likelihood ratio tests. Depending on time, other topics may be added or removed.\n\n\n## Recommended Texts\n\n1.  Modern Mathematical Statistics (MMS) with Applications, by Jay L. Devore and Kenneth N. Berk , **Third Edition**, Springer, 2021. (available online for free through the Broome Library).\n\n## Math Foundations\n\nHave a strong math foundation is necessary to be successful in the course. We will be utilizing topics related to:\n\n- Calculus\n- Probability Theory\n- Algebra\n\nYou can try out these problems to get an idea of the type of math we will be doing in this class [here](https://m453.inqs.info/hw/hw0).\n\n\n# Generative AI\n\n## Use of Generative AI Policy\n\nThe use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to complete any part or all of an assignment/exam is strictly prohibited in this class. This includes, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Claude, Meta AI, and Google Gemini.\n\n::: fragment\n\nYou may use AI to enhance you understanding of the material.\n\n:::\n\n::: fragment\n\nYou may not use AI to complete assignments.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: fragment\n\nYou may not upload any course material to any AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, Meta AI, and Google Gemini.  Exceptions are allowed for [DASS](https://www.csuci.edu/dass/)-approved services.\n\n:::\n\n## Use of AI\n\nThere are consequences when you use of AI:\n\n- Educational Mislearning\n- Trusting AI\n- Stolen Work\n- Privacy Concerns\n- Environmental Impacts\n- Working Exploitation\n\n\n\n## Educational Mislearning\n\nThe purpose of this class, and college, is for you to learn about critical thinking skills and perseverance. Using AI will only teach you how to get an answer, which may or may not be correct. \n\n::: fragment\nYou will not develop the skills needed to problem solve a challenge. Additionally, developing grit is essential to become successful in college and life. There is no easy way out and AI is an illusion to your success in life.\n:::\n\n\n::: fragment\nTo learn something, it requires hours of work! If not years!\n:::\n\n## Trusting AI\n\nWhen using AI, you must acknowledge its limitations:\n\n::: incremental\n\n- Responses provided may be incorrect\n\n- Responses may not be fair\n\n- Companies may manipulate responses and/or terms of service for their benefit\n\n- Companies may not have your best interst in mind\n:::\n\n::: fragment\n\n**You should always proceed with caution utilizing these tools!**\n\n:::\n\n## Stolen Work\n\n::: fragment\nAdditionally, all these individuals are not receiving any royalties for the work to be used in creating generative AI models.\n:::\n\n\n::: fragment\n[Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2024/07/29/taylor-francis-ai-deal-sets-worrying-precedent) and [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/is-ai-art-stealing-from-artists) highlight individual's concern of their work being used to train AI models.\n:::\n\n\n## Privacy Concerns\n\nThe use of generative AI raises concerns of what data is being harvested from us, possibly without informed consent or knowledge of impacts. \n\n::: fragment\nWhen you use any large language models, you do not know what information is being harvested from you.\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nDo you want to upload your thoughts and ideas to a company that can monetize, and possibly exploit you.\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nDoes your Professors consent with you uploading their assignments to large language models?\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nStanford provided a [report](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/privacy-ai-era-how-do-we-protect-our-personal-information) highlighting the risks of our personal data use in large language models.\n:::\n\n## Environmental Impact\n\nIn order to run these large language models, companies need to use a large amounts of energy. This is because large servers are needed to both train and execute a model. \n\n::: fragment\nThe [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-08-15/editorial-generative-ai-is-a-leading-contributor-to-our-energy-consumption-how-will-this-impact-our-climate) reports the potential impact that running AI models in California.\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nAdditionally, [Time](https://time.com/6987773/ai-data-centers-energy-usage-climate-change/) reports that a ChatGPT query uses ten times more energy than a Google search query, and global AI demands can consume of 1 trillion gallons of water by 2027.\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nThere are also environmental justice questions about where these data centers are constructed.\n:::\n\n## Worker Exploitation\n\nThe [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/28/scale-ai-remotasks-philippines-artificial-intelligence/) and Time ([Article 1](https://time.com/6147458/facebook-africa-content-moderation-employee-treatment/) and [Article 2](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/)) reported that AI companies utilize \"digital sweatshops\" to classify data points for model training. \n\n::: fragment\nThere is a human cost from the Global South, both financially and mentally, to develop the AI models for users in the United States and Europe.\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nWe must be conscious consumers and demand more from these companies to provide safe working conditions and livable wages.\n:::\n\n\n## Is Using AI Bad?\n\n::: fragment\nYes/No/I don't know\n:::\n\n\n## Privacy Concerns Links\n\n- [OpenAI Says It’s Scanning Users’ ChatGPT Conversations and Reporting Content to the Police](https://futurism.com/openai-scanning-conversations-police)\n- [Privacy in an AI Era: How Do We Protect Our Personal Information?](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/privacy-ai-era-how-do-we-protect-our-personal-information)\n\n## Labor Violations Links\n\n- [The Emotional Labor Behind AI Intimacy](https://data-workers.org/michael/)\n- [How thousands of ‘overworked, underpaid' humans train Google’s AI to seem smart](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/11/google-gemini-ai-training-humans)\n\n## Affecting Communities Links\n\n- [AI surveillance and data colonialism shape African conflicts](https://africainfact.com/ai-surveillance-and-data-colonialism-shape-african-conflicts/)\n- [African workers are taking on Meta and the world should pay attention](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/4/1/african-workers-are-taking-on-meta-and-the-world-should-pay-attention)\n- [‘It’s destroyed me completely’: Kenyan moderators decry toll of training of AI models](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/02/ai-chatbot-training-human-toll-content-moderator-meta-openai)\n\n- [The AI Industry Is Traumatizing Desperate Contractors in the Developing World for Pennies](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-industry-traumatizing-contractors)\n\n- [ChatGPT advises women to ask for lower salaries, study finds](https://thenextweb.com/news/chatgpt-advises-women-to-ask-for-lower-salaries-finds-new-study)\n\n- [The Impact of the Use of AI on People with Disabilities](https://www.nycbar.org/reports/the-impact-of-the-use-of-ai-on-people-with-disabilities/)\n\n## Ideas and Learning Links\n\n- [Student's Right to Refuse AI](https://refusal.blog/2025/08/29/a-students-right-to-refuse-generative-ai/)\n\n- [AI is homogenizing your thoughts](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/ai-is-homogenizing-our-thoughts?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dhfacebook&utm_content=app.dashsocial.com/newyorkermag/library/media/546600666)\n\n- [The Incuriosity Engine](https://cooperlund.medium.com/the-incuriosity-engine-16bdf41e229d)\n\n- [New Junior Developers Can't Actually Code](https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-and-learning)\n\n## Environmental Costs\n\n- ['I can't drink the water' -
